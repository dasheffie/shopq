# ShopQ Progress Log

## Context
- This is a Lodestar app targeting shopq.com domain
- Goal: Build a high-scoring shopping list app (target: >71 Lodestar score)
- Pattern: Follow GifCard (our top scorer) - localStorage, minimal server

## Iteration 0 - Setup
- PRD created with 10 user stories
- Tech stack: Vanilla JS, localStorage, Express static server
- Using server-utils.js from ../../../lib/server-utils.js

## Codebase Patterns
1. Server: Copy pattern from GifCard - minimal Express serving static files
2. Frontend: Single index.html with inline <style> and <script>
3. Storage: All data in localStorage, JSON stringify/parse
4. No external APIs, no databases, no authentication

## Next Steps
- Create src/server.js (copy from GifCard)
- Create public/index.html with app UI
- Implement user stories in priority order
